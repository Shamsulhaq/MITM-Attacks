# Main In The Middle Attacks

### ARP Poisoning

This is one of the most dangerous and effective attacks that can be used to *redirect packets to and from any client to our device* and since we have the network key, we can read/modify/drop the packets. This allows us to launch very powerful attacks. It's very hard to protect against it as it exploits the insecure way that ARP works.

ARP security issues:
- Each ARP request/response is trusted.
- Clients can accept responses even if they did not send request.

**ARPSPOOF**

Arpspoof is a tool part of a suit called dnsiff, which contains a number of network penetration tools. Arpspoof can be used to launch a MITM and redirect traffic to flow through our device.

1. Command tell the  target client that I am the router.
```
arpspoof -i [interface] -t [target IP] [AP IP]
Ex: arpsoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.1
````

2. Command tell the AP that I am the target client.
```
aprspoof -i [interface] -t [AP IP][target IP]
Ex: arpsoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.5
```

3. Enable IP forward to allow packets to flow through our device without being dropped.

### MAN IN THE MIDDLE FRAMEWORK (MITMf)

MITMf is a framework that allows to launch a number of MITM attacks. MITMf also starts SSLstrip automatically to bypass HTTPS/SSL.

```
mitmf-arp-spoof-gateway [GATEWAY IP] --targets [TARGET IPs] -i [interface]
Ex: mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 10.20.14.1 --targets 10.20.14.206 - eth0/wlan0
```
